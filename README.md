# Introduction to FinTech using Excel [ in an R-assisted Learning Environment ]

## About this textbook

FinTech has contributed heavily in many areas once dominated by traditional finance, such as
borrowing and lending, payment systems, auditing, distributed ledgers, seamless transfer of 
money, and a system that does not need trust. To understand those topics, learners 
must learn one programming language. On the other hand, traditional finance covers 
Corporate Finance, Portfolio Theory, Financial Modeling using Excel, and Options and 
Futures. For those courses, Excel is used as a computational tool. 

There is no doubt that a considerable barrier exists between those two distinct areas: 
FinTech and traditional finance. In a sense, students and readers need a book or course to help 
them cross this barrier. This book serves this very need. Excel is used as a computational
 tool. However, Excel is insufficient since hands-on experience is vital to understanding 
advanced FinTech concepts. For this purpose, many hidden functions in R will be offered. 
The beauty is that learners, students, and potential instructors don't need any prior 
knowledge related to R to use this book.
